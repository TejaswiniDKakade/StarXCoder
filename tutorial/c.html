        <h2>What is C ?</h2>
        <p>C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.
            <br>
            It is a very popular language, despite being old.
            <br>
            C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.</p>

           <h3> Getting Started with C</h3>
        <h4>Requirements before you start</h4>
       <p>To start using C, you need two things: <br>
        * A text editor, like Notepad, or an IDE, like VSCode to act as a platform for you to write C code <br>
        * A compiler, like GCC to translate the C code you have written which is a high-level language into a low-level language that the computer will understand.</p> 
 

        <h4>What is an IDE?</h4>
      <p>  <b> IDE stands for an Integrated Development Environment.</b><br>
        * It is nothing more than an enhanced version of a text editor that helps you write more efficient and nicer code. <br>
        * It helps to differentiate different parts of your codes with different colors and notifies you if you are missing some semicolon or bracket at some place by highlighting that area. <br>
        * A lot of IDEs are available, such as DEVC++ or Code Blocks, but we will prefer using VS Code for this tutorial series.</p>
 

        <h4>Installing VSCode</h4><br>
       <p>&nbsp;  Visit <a href=https://code.visualstudio.com/download>https://code.visualstudio.com/download</a> <br>
        * Click on the download option as per your operating system. <br>
        * After the download is completed, open the setup and run it by saving VS Code in the default location without changing any settings. <br>
        * You will need to click the next button again and again until the installation process begins.</p>
 
        <br>
        <h4>What is a Compiler?</h4>
      <p>  * A compiler is used to run the program of a certain language which is generally high-level by converting the code into a language that is low-level that our computer could understand. <br>
        * There are a lot of compilers available, but we will proceed with teaching you to use MinGW for this course because it will fulfill all of our requirements, and also it is recommended by Microsoft itself. </p>
 

        <h4>Setting up the compiler</h4>
       <p> Visit <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp"> https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp</a> <br>
        * Select C++ from the sidebar.
        <br>* Choose “GCC via Mingw-w64 on Windows” from the options shown there.
        <br>* Select the install sourceforge option.
        <br>* After the downloading gets completed, run the setup and choose all the default options as we did while installing VS Code.
        </p>

        <h4>Setting Path for Compiler</h4>
       <p> Go to the C directory. <br>* Navigate into the Program Files. Then, open MinGW-64. <br>* Open MinGW-32. And then the bin folder. <br>* After reaching the bin, save the path or URL to the bin.
        <br>* Then go to the properties of ‘This PC’.
       <br>* Select ‘Advance System Settings’.
       <br>* Select the ‘Environment Variable’ option.
       <br>* Add the copied path to the Environment Variable.
       <br>* And now,  you can visit your IDE and run your C programs on it. The configuration part is done.
        </p>

        <p>An escape sequence is a sequence of characters; it doesn't represent itself (but is translated into another character) when used inside string literal or character. Some of the escape sequence characters are as follows:
        </p>
        
        <h6>Alarm or beep </h6> 
            it produce a beep sound

        <!-- ************************************ variables ********************************************* -->

        <h3 style="color:rgb(144, 12, 177) ;">  Variables</h3>

        A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume).

        <br>

        <h5>*Rules for C variables:-</h5>

        <p>A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
            <br>
            A variable name cannot start with a number <br>
            
            A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
            <br>
            Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables).
            <br>
            A variable cannot include any white space in its name.
            <br>
            The name should not be a reserved keyword or any special character.
        </p>

            <!-- **********************Data types ********************** -->
            <h3 style="color:rgb(144, 12, 177) ;"> C Data Types & Constants </h3>
            
            
            <p> As explained previously, a variable in C must be a specified data type, and you must use a format specifier inside the printf function to display the value present in the variable
                <br>
            The data type specifies the size and type of information the variable will store.
                <br>
            <h4>Datatype</h4>
                It is the type of value which the variable holds.
                <br>
                The data type is a collection of data with values having fixed values, meaning as well as its characteristics.

                      <h4>  C Constants</h4>
            When you don't want the variables you declare to get modified intentionally or mistakenly in the later part of your program by you or others, you use the const keyword (this will declare the variable as "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only). <br>
            You should always declare the variable as constant when you have values that are unlikely to change, like any mathematical constant as PI. <br>
            When you declare a constant variable, it must be assigned a value. <br>

            <h3 style="color:rgb(144, 12, 177) ;"> Operators</h3>
          <p> Special symbols that are used to perform actions or operations are known as operators. They could be both unary or binary.
            <br>
            For example, the symbol asterisk (*) is used to perform multiplication in C so it is an operator and it is a binary operator.
            <br>
            This section covers all types of operators. </p>

                <h3 style="color:rgb(144, 12, 177) ;"> Conditional Statement </h3>

                <p>Sometimes, we wish to execute one set of instructions if a particular condition is met, and another set of instructions if it is not. This kind of situation is deal with in C language using a decision control system. 
                  <br>
                  The condition for the if statement is always enclosed within a pair of parentheses. If the condition is true, then the set of statements following the if statement will execute. And if the condition evaluates to false, then the statement will not execute, instead, the program skips that enclosed part of the code.
                  <br>
                  An expression in if statements are defined using relational operators. Comparing two values using relational operators allows us to determine whether they are equal, unequal, greater than, or less than.
                  <br>
                  If we want to execute a particular code in some situation and its vice versa /opposite/or different code if that situation doesn’t occurs then if..else statements can be used. Its all depend on the condition. If the condition returns true value the situation has occurred and the true part of code will be executed and if condition returns false value false part of the code will be executed
                  <br>
                  The statement written in an if block will execute when the expression following if evaluates to true. But when the if block is followed by an else block, then when the condition written in the if block turns to be false, the set of statements in the else block will execute.
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  Following is the syntax of if-else statements:
                  <br>

                  <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
                    if ( condition ){ <br>
                     &nbsp; statements; <br> } <br>
                     else if(/*condition*/) <br>
                      { <br>
                        &nbsp; statements <br>
                      } <br>
                       else { <br>
                        &nbsp; statements; <br> }
                  </div>
                 
                 <h4> Switch Case Statements</h4>
                  <h5>What is Switch?</h5>
                  The control statement that allows us to make a decision effectively from the number of choices is called a switch, or a switch case-default since these three keywords go together to make up the control statement. The expression in switch returns an integral value, which is then compared with different cases. Switch executes that block of code, which matches the case value. If the value does not match with any of the cases, then the default block is executed. 
                  <br>
                  
                  Following are the syntax of Switch case statement: <br>

                  {  <br>
                  case {value 1} :  <br>
                  &nbsp;case 1 executed ; <br>

              <!-- ********************* iteration statement ************************** -->

              <h3 style="color:rgb(144, 12, 177) ;"> Iteration Statement </h3>

              <p>
                In programming, we often have to perform an action, again and again, with little or no variations in the details each time they are executed. This need is met by a mechanism known as a loop.
                <br>
                The versatility of the computer lies in its ability to perform the set of instructions repeatedly. This involves repeating some code in the program, either a specified number of times or until a particular condition is satisfied. Loop-controlled instructions are used to perform this repetitive operation efficiently ensuring the program doesn’t look redundant at the same time due to the repetitions.
                <br>
                Following are the three types of loops in C programming.
                <ul>
                  <li>For loop</li>
                  <li> While loop</li>
                  <li>do-while loop</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Types of Loops</h4>
               <h5> Entry Controlled loops</h5>
                
                In entry controlled loops, the test condition is evaluated before entering the loop body. The for Loop and the while Loop are examples of entry-controlled loops.
                
                <h5>Exit Controlled Loops</h5>
                
                In exit-controlled loops, the test condition is tested at the end of the loop. Regardless of whether the test condition is true or false, the loop body will execute at least once. The do-while loop is an example of an exit-controlled loop.
              
            
              <h4>while loop</h4>
              The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:
              <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
                while (condition) { <br>
                  //set of statements <br>
                }
              </div>

              <h4>do while loop</h4>
              The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.
              <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
                do { <br>
                  // set of statements  <br>
                } <br>
                while (condition); <br>
              </div>

              <h4>for loop</h4>
              A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows us to efficiently write a loop that will execute a specific number of times. The for loop working is as follows:
                <br>
              The initialization statement is executed only once; in this statement, we initialize a variable to some value.
              <br>
              In the second step, the test expression is evaluated. Suppose the test expression is evaluated to be true. In that case, the for loop keeps running, and the test expression is re-evaluated, but if the test expression is evaluated to false, then the for loop terminates.
              <br>
              The loop keeps executing until the test expression is false. When the test expression is false, then the loop terminates. 
               
              <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
                for (initialise counter; test counter; increment / decrement counter) <br>
                { <br>
                    //set of statements  <br>
                }
              </div>

              <h4>Break </h4>
                  When C reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the block.
                  <br>
                  This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block.
                  <br>
                  When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There is no need for more testing.
                  <br>
                  A break can save a lot of execution time because it "ignores" the execution of all the rest of the code in the block. <br><br>
                  <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
                    #include <<stdio.h>stdio.h>
                      <br>
                      int main() <br>
                      { <br>
                    &nbsp; int i = 0;  <br>
                    &nbsp; while (1)  <br>
                    &nbsp; {  <br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;  if (i > 5)  <br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;  { <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     break;  <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; }  <br>
                        &nbsp;  printf("%d ", i);  <br>
                        &nbsp; i++;  <br>
                        &nbsp;}<br>
                        &nbsp; return 0;  <br>
                }
                  </div>

                  <h4>Continue</h4>
                  The continue statement is used inside loops in C Language. When a continue statement is encountered inside the loop, the control jumps to the beginning of the loop for the next iteration, skipping the execution of statements inside the body of the loop after the continue statement. <br>
                  It is used to bring the control to the next iteration of the loop. <br>
                  Typically, the continue statement skips some code inside the loop and lets the program move on with the next iteration. <br>
                  It is mainly used for a condition so that we can skip some lines of code for a particular condition. <br>
                  It forces the next iteration to follow in the loop unlike a break statement, which terminates the loop itself the moment it is encountered. <br>
                  <br>
                  <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
                    #include <<stdio.h>stdio.h>
                      <br>

            <!-- **************************** Array ******************************* -->

            <h3 style="color:rgb(144, 12, 177) ;"> Array </h3>

            <p>An array is a collection of data items of the same data type. And it is also known as a subscript variable.
              <br>
              Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
              <br>
              To create an array, define the data type (like int) and specify the name of the array followed by square brackets [].
              <br>
              To insert values to it, use a comma-separated list, inside curly braces:
              <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
                int Num[] = {2, 5, 7, 10};
              </div> <br>
              <h5>Dimensions of an array</h5>
             <li> A one-dimensional array is like a list.</li>
            <li>A two-dimensional array is like a table.</li>
            </p>
            

            <!-- ***************************** pointer ***************************** -->
            <h3 style="color:rgb(144, 12, 177) ;"> Pointer </h3>
            
            <p>When we initialise an array, we usually come to know about the,

              Memory block which is the space a variable gets in RAM. We can think of that space as a block.
              Name of the memory block which is the variable’s name itself.
              Content of that block that is the value stored in that variable
              Address of the memory block assigned to the variable which is a unique address that allows us to access that variable.
               <br>
              
              <h4>What is a Pointer?</h4>
              Pointer is a variable that contains the address of another variable. It means, it is a variable that points to any other variable. <br>
              Although this is itself a variable, this contains the address or memory address of any other variable. <br>
              It can be of type int, char, array, function, or even any other pointer.
              Its size depends on the architecture. <br>
              Pointers in C Language can be declared using *(asterisk symbol). <br>
              So, pointers are nothing but variables that store addresses of other variables, and by using pointers, we can access other variables too and can even manipulate them.

            <h3 style="color:rgb(144, 12, 177) ;"> Structure </h3>

            <p> 
             <h4> What are Structures in C?</h4>
              Structures are usually used when we wish to store data of different data types together. For example, if we want to store information about a book, there could be a number of parameters defining a book. 
              <br>
              Books have a title, an author name, the number of pages, and a price. All of the book attributes belong to different data types. The titles and author names must be strings, but the prices and number of pages must be numerical. 
              <br>
              <br>
              One way to store the data is to construct individual arrays, and another method is to use a structure variable. It is to keep in mind that structure elements are always stored in contiguous memory locations.
              <br>
               <br>
              
              <h5>*Creating a struct element</h5>
              Basic syntax for declaring a struct is,   <br>

            <p>
              
              Just like Structures, the union is a user-defined data type.  All the members in unions share the same memory location. The union is a data type that allows different data belonging to different data types to be stored in the same memory locations. One of the advantages of using a union is that it provides an efficient way of reusing the memory location, as only one of its members can be accessed at a time. A union is used in the same way we declare and use a structure. The difference lies just in the way memory is allocated to their members.
              <br>

              <h5>Defining a Union</h5>
              We use the union keyword to define the union.

                 <h3 style="color:rgb(144, 12, 177) ;"> C Typedef </h3>
                  In C programming, a typedef declaration is used to create shorter and more meaningful and convenient to use names for keywords already defined by C like int, float, and char.
                  <br>
                   <br>
                  
                  <h4>What is a typedef in C?</h4>
                  A typedef is a keyword that is used to assign alternative names to existing datatypes. We use typedef with user defined datatypes, when the names of the datatypes become slightly complicated to use in programs. Typedefs can be used to:
                  <br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Make a more complex definition reusable by abbreviating it to something less complex.</li>
                    <li>Provide more clarity to the code</li>
                    <li>Make it easier to change the underlying data types that we use</li>
                    <li>Make the code more clear and easier to modify.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  
                  Following is the syntax for using typedef,
                  <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
                    typedef <<previous_name>previous_name> <<alias_name>alias_name>
                  </div>

                <p>
                <h3 style="color:rgb(144, 12, 177) ;"> File Handling Basics</h3> 
                  A large program deployed for heavy applications cannot function without files, since we can get input from them as well as print output from them very easily. We can also save a lot of program space by accessing the file's data only when needed, making the program more efficient and faster.
                  <br>
                  
                  <h4>Why do we need to handle files in C?</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Files are used to store content hence reducing the actual program's size.</li>
                    <li>We can read or access data from files.  </li>
                    <li>The data in files remain stored even after the program's execution is terminated.</li>
                  </ul>
                
                  
                  Files are stored in non-volatile memory. To understand what a non-volatile memory is and how it is better in terms of storing things for longer, we have to see the differences between volatile and non-volatile memory.

                 <br><br>
                  <h5>What are the different type of files?</h5>
                  <br>
                <h5><u>There are two types of files:</u></h5>
                  
                  <h4><li>Binary Files</li> </h4>
                  
                  Binary files store data in 01 i.e., binary format. They are not directly readable. In order to read binary files, you will need software or an application. An example of binary file is a .bin file.
                  
                <h4><li>Text Files</li> </h4>
                  
                  Text files store data in a simple text format. They are directly readable and no external software is required to access them. An example of a text file is a .txt file.

                  <br><br><br>
                  <br>

                  <h4>**Operations on Files **</h4>
                  There are basically four operations we can perform on files in C:
                  
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  
                  <h5>Creating a File:</h5>
                  We can create a file using C language, in any directory, without even leaving our compiler. We can select the name or type we want our file to have, along with its location.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                   
                  
                <h5> Opening a File:</h5>
                  We can open an existing file and create a new file and open it using our program. We can perform different operations on a file after it has been opened.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                   
                  
                <h5>Closing a File:</h5>
                  When we are done with the file, meaning that we have performed whatever we want to perform on our file, we can close the file using the close function.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                   
                  
                <h5> Read/Write to a file:</h5>
                  After opening a file, we can access its contents and read, write, or update them.

                   
                </p>
